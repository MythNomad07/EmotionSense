EmotionSense â€“ Real-Time Emotion Detection Dashboard

This project is a real-time AI-powered emotion recognition system built with React.js, Face-API.js, and Node.js. It detects facial expressions via webcam and provides live emotion analytics with detailed visualization, data export, and session tracking features. The system integrates modern frontend design with machine learning models to deliver interactive emotional insights.

Overview

The application captures usersâ€™ facial expressions in real-time and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. It visualizes trends and distributions through interactive charts while allowing users to save, reset, and export session data.
